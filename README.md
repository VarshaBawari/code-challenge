# code-challenge
The task is to write a small language game. The player will see a word in language „one“ on the screen. While this word is displayed, a word in language „two“ will fall down on the screen. The player will have to choose if the falling word is the correct translation or a wrong translation. The player needs to answer, before the word reaches the bottom of the screen. Include a counter that gives the player feedback.
